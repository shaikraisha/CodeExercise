# Submission Notes

These notes will be read by HubSpot developers. Drop us a line!

## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

If given more time, I will do the points mentioned below-

1. The code in structured format (screenshot attached in assets) as I have started but couldn't complete.
2. Made reusable components like dropdown and passed parameters to it.
3. Added react error boundary
4. Implement react context provider and consumer for state management as the application is small redux is not required.
5. Written test cases using Reat testing library with jest.
6. Fuzzy search using react-fuzzy-search module.
7. Added some animations on dropdown open to make it more attractive
8. React lazy loading on images to get the application load fast.

## How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?

I got deviated from functional component DRY code development to single class component due to time constraint and current project production release works.

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?

Completed the main logic for both the assignments given.
